- OS connects applications to hardware
- Mechanisms: operations sypported by lower-layer 
- Policies: criteria used to decide how to allocate resources
- OS has three general aspects:
    - Virtualization: Taking limited resource and transform into more general resource 
    - Concurrency: Multiple things happening at the same time
    - Persistence: Data is stored even after the program is terminated
- Kernel: Collection of code that implements above functionalities
